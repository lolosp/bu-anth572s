# What is this course? 


This is a statistics class, but the purpose of this course is not to teach you statistics...

. . .

but rather how to think about data, shape it into analyzable form, and understand both the data and statistics mean



##  Learning goals 

You will be introduced to:

::: {.incremental}
- The R programming language 
- Data management and wrangling (boo)
- Summary of more basic statistics
- Data reduction
- Generalized linear models
- And a lot more... 
:::


## 

The goal of this course is to get you comfortable thinking, using, and interpreting data, while getting you up to speed with scientific programming principles

## 

In this course, we will focus on the data analysis pipeline (and some R programming) because:

::: {.incremental}
1. These teach critical thinking skills, which will serve you in any career path
2. These are more interesting than equations
3. Once you have mastered these skills, you can pick up specific statistical analyses
:::


# Course Outline

## Schedule 

::: {.incremental}
- Weeks 1-3: Basics of R, data visualization, data wrangling
- Weeks 4-6: Review of fundamental concepts in statistics
- Week 9: Dimensionality reduction
- Weeks 13-14: Open to your suggestions!
- Week 15: p-values, alternatives, and power calculations
:::

## Evaluation

::: {.incremental}
- Assignments - 30% - 6 throughout the term
- Quiz - 20% - One quiz, testing core concepts in the course
- Term project - 50% - Analyze real-world data in groups and report results

## Instructor

Dr. Laure Spake 
<br>Biological anthropologist 
<br> 
<br> Email: lspake@binghamton.edu
<br> Office hours: Wed. 11:00am - 1:00pm, Science I Rm 219


## About office hours

Please use them! I am here for you.

<br> This is an *intensive* and *fast-paced* course. If you need help, or you are struggling to grasp a concept, please come see me early

<br> There is access to computing resources during my office hours.

## Course delivery

We will be using two main spaces to deliver this course: 

1. *Brightspace* - this is where I will post documents such as lecture slides, the syllabus, review materials for the quiz, and instructions for the term project

. . . 

2. *Posit Cloud* - this is an integrated environment that allows you to use R and RStudio (more on this later) in your browser without needing to download software on your computer. You will use this to retrieve and complete in-class exercises, assignments, and the term project. 

## Note on classes over the semester

My aim is to deliver each and every lecture and lab in person this term. Your experience in this course will be 100% better if you do come to class and lab.

. . . 

If you are ill, please stay home. My slides and exercises are wordy, and you can come to office hours to catch up.

. . . 

If I am ill, I will either hold class on Zoom or record a lecture for you to watch asynchronously.

:::

## Sharing and reusing code

::: {.incremental}
- There is lots of code available to you on the internet, and unless an assignment specifically says not to, you may use it to help write your own code
- If you do use code from an online source, please cite it at the end of your documents
- Any code used but not cited is considered plagiarism (CC-BY licenses)
:::

## Sharing and reusing code

::: {.incremental}
- You are welcome to work together to solve any of the assignments or exercises, but please submit your own assignment/exercise files
- You may not copy or make direct use of code from another student
- You may not copy or make direct use of code from another group for the term project

# Introduction to the R computing environment 


##

::: callout-note
## Learning objectives
**At the end of this lesson you will:**

-   Differentiate between R and RStudio.
-   Understand and navigate the different components of RStudio.
:::

## What is R? 

- **R** is a programming language that is based off S, a statistical programming language developed in the 1970-90s
- **R** was created in 1991 and released to the public under a free and open license in 2000
- **R** is fully **open source**, meaning that anyone can access and modify the source code
- **R** has industry-leading graphics capability, which makes it super popular for creating scientific graphics

## 

Because R is open-source, developers are able to create and share packages (add-ons) to facilitate complicated statistical procedures

. . . 

<br> <br> From a scientific computing perspective, this is super useful!

## The R system 

There are two "components" of R:

- R itself, also known as *base R*, is distributed freely on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
- Packages that extend functionalities:
  * Some are available on CRAN (10,000+)
  * Many more are in development or not reviewed by CRAN and available on personal websites or GitHub (number unknown)

## Working in R

::: {.column width="40%"}
Base R has a very bare interface

## Working in R

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Base R has a very bare interface
<br>

If you wanted to work with plots, you'd need to open a separate window
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/base-r-graphics.png)
:::

::::

## Working in RStudio

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
For this reason, most people who work in R work in a text editor. 

<br>

The most popular is RStudio.

<br>

This is what we'll be using.

# Getting started with RStudio in the cloud

## The console

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

This is where all your computations happen 
:::

::::

## The console

```{r}
#| output-location: column-fragment
5 + 2
```


## The console

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

## The enviroment

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

This is where all the objects available to you are displayed. 

<br>

These objects can be datasets, lists, vectors, models, etc (more on this later)

## The viewer

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

The viewer pane has many sub-panels - you can use it to flip between seeing your files and your plots. 

You can also use it to see which pacakges you have installed and access the documentation for each package/function you use.

## The script(s)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

When you write code that you want to save, you can develop it in a script. 

There are multiple types of scripting files - more on that later.
