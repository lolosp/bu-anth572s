## Building on foundations

We have now introduced the fundamentals of hypothesis testing with z-scores and means of samples (z and t)

Now we're going to start dealing with two sample tests 


# Writing hypotheses


:::{.incremental}
Good set of null/alternate hypotheses should: 

  1. The statistic/parameter to be compared
  2. The direction/non-direction of the effect
  3. A value of interest for the statistic/parameter
  
:::

## More details on the null

The null hypothesis should always express that there is no difference from the value of interest  

In other words, you can always say "The mean is 0"

## Scripts for the null and alternate

Test whether a sample from a population has a mean that is greater than 9

Null: The mean is 9. Think of it as: $\mu$ = 9

Alternate: The mean is greater than 9. Think of it as: $\mu$ > 9


## Example

The Lourdes hospital emergency room claims that the mean waiting time for their patients is 2 hours. You observe patients waiting in the ER for a morning shift, finding that they wait an average of 2.5 hours with a standard deviation of 15 minutes.  

. . . 

H~0~: The mean waiting time is 2 hours
$\mu$ = 2

. . . 

H~1~: The mean waiting time is not 2 hours
$\mu$ $\neq$ = 2

## Example

Eight participants in an experimental procedure are tested. Their scores are: 14, 8, 6, 5, 13, 19, 19, and 6. The population of people not given the experimental procedure is normally distributed with a mean of 6. Does the experimental procedure make a difference?

. . . 

H~0~: The mean test score is 6
$\mu$ = 6

. . . 

H~1~: The mean test score is not 6
$\mu$ $\neq$ = 6

## Example

Participants engage in a study to test whether humans adhere to 24 hour sleep-wake cycles when they have no access to natural light. At the end of the trial, the duration of sleep-wake cycles for the participants in hours is: 25, 27, 23, 24, 25.

. . . 

H~0~: The mean sleep cycle length is 24 hours
$\mu$ = 24

. . . 

H~1~: The mean sleep cycle length is not 24 hours
$\mu$ $\neq$ = 24

# Paired sample t-test

## Testing for differences in the same individuals

Recall our class social intervention example. We could either compare the test scores for individuals who undergo the intervention and those who do not 

. . . 

Or, we could have the participants take a test, then undergo the intervention, then be re-tested

## Paired sample t-test

The paired sample t-test is used in situations where we have multiple scores from the same individual/subject 

. . . 

In these situations, we are really interested in the distributions of the differences between the first and second measurements. 

. . . 

If the distribution is different from 0, then we can infer that there is a difference between the groups.


## Paired sample t-test

![](images/paired-t-formula.png)

The test formula is similar to the simple t test but instead of $\bar{x}$ we are now testing for the mean of differences in scores denoted $\bar{d}$

## An example

Let's say we collect the following pre and post intervention scores

```{r}
pre <- c(75, 80, 78, 90, 77, 82, 85, 88, 78, 92)
post <- c(78, 83, 77, 92, 79, 89, 84, 90, 77, 93)
```

## 1. State the null and alternate hypothesis

H~0~: The mean difference in test scores is 0 
<br>H~1~: The mean difference in test scores is not 0 

## 2. Compute your comparison distribution 

Mean = 0

## 3. Calculate the critical value

Set the alpha at 0.05. Then divide by two

```{r}
crit <- qt(c(0.025, 0.975), df = 9)
crit
```

## 4. Calculate the test statistic

First step is to calculate the differences and the standard deviation for the difference, then compute the t statistic

```{r}
d <- post-pre
t <- mean(d)/(sd(d)/sqrt(10))
t
```

## 5. Conclude on the null 

Do we reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it?

```{r}
crit
t
```


# Independent sample t-tests

## Testing for difference in means in two samples

So far, we have learned procedures for a single individual, for a single sample, and for paired measurements. 

In reality, most of the time, we don't know much about the population and we have two groups/samples that we want to compare.

## Example

Researchers are interested in knowing whether journaling about statistics can affect students' performance in their statistics courses. Two groups of 15 students are asked to journal 10 minutes a day. One is asked to write positive thoughts, the other to write about their fears. After 30 days we give them a test. We want to know if the groups' tests scores are different.

## Independent sample t-test

This variation of the t-test tests for differences in means between samples

## Independent sample t-test

![](images/differences-distribution-means2.jpeg){height=600}


## Independent sample t-test

The logic of the test means that the comparison distribution is now the diresibution of differences between the means.

## Independent sample t-test

We are now testing the null hypothesis that the population means are the same. 

. . . 

If the population means are the same, we can also reasonably assume that the population variances/standard deviations are the same.

. . . 

If the population variances are the same, we can get a better estimate by combining the standard deviations from each sample


## Independent sample t-test

![](images/indep-sample-t-formula.png){height=200}
s^2^~p~ is the pooled sample variance

## Independent sample t-test

![](images/sample-var-t-test.png){height=200}


## Independent sample t-test

In simple words, the test statistic is now the difference between the means of the sample divided by the pooled sample variance.

## Degrees of freedom 

Degrees of freedom in the two-sample t-test is the total number of items sampled minus the number of samples, or mathematically:

*n~1~* + *n~2~* - 2

## Null and alternate hypothesis 

H~0~: There is no difference in the mean of *var* between the groups
<br>H~1~: There is a difference in the mean of *var* between the groups

## Assumptions for the two-sample t-test

:::{.incremental}

1. The observations in the groups are independent of each other
2. The two populations are approximately normal
3. The two populations have equal variance (and therefore standard deviations)

::: 

. . . 

Important!

## Hypothesis testing process 

From now on, it gets harder to calculate test statistics and critical values. 

. . .

You'll not be asked to solve for test values anymore - you'll run the appropriate commands in R instead. 

. . . 

You should still know and follow the modified hypothesis testing processes.

## Hypothesis testing process

:::{.incremental}

1. State the null and alternate hypotheses
2. Set your significance level 
3. Compute the test statistic and significance level
4. Conclude on the null hypothesis
:::

## An example

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
penguins <- penguins
adelie <- subset(penguins, species == "Adelie")
gentoo <- subset(penguins, species == "Gentoo")

```

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%"}

Is there a difference in bill length between Adelie and Gentoo penguins?

:::

:::{.column width="40%"}
![](images/penguins.png)

:::

::::

## 1. State the null and alternate hypotheses

  

. . . 

<br>H~0~: There is no difference in mean bill length between Adelie and Gentoo penguins

. . . 

<br>H~1~: There is a difference in mean bill length between Adelie and Gentoo penguins

## 2. Set a significance level 

We're going to work with $\alpha$ = 0.05

## 3. Calculate the test statistic

```{r}
test1 <- t.test(adelie$bill_length_mm, gentoo$bill_length_mm, 
                var.equal = TRUE)
test1

```

## 4. Conclude on the null hypothesis 

```{r}
test1$p.value 
test1$p.value < 0.05
```

What do we conclude about the null hypothesis?

## 4. Conclude on the null hypothesis 

*REMEMBER* that the probability (p-value) and the critical value are instrinsically linked - you can toggle between them using the t-table

```{r}
pt(-1.5, df = 30)

qt(0.07203, df = 30)

```




# Interpreting *p*-values

## The meaning of the *p*-value

The *p*-value is often misunderstood. 

. . . 

The *p*-value is the probability of observing data as or more extreme as our data if the null hypothesis is true.

## The meaning of the *p*-value

When we set $\alpha$, we set the *p*-value at which we consider that our data are too extreme to be likely to arise by chance. 

. . . 

The *p*-value is not magic, it is set by researchers before they begin hypothesis testing and is completely linked to the test statistic

. . . 

In turn, the test statistic is partly dictated by sample size 

## The meaning of the *p*-value

So, the *p*-value is quite subjective and this is an incontournable fact of statistics.
