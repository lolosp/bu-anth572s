## Problem 1

Suppose that a test of sensitivity to cilantro's soapy taste is known to have a mean of 20, a standard deviation of 3, and to follow a normal curve. What percentage of people have scores *above* 24?

### Step 1: convert to a z-score

Use the value, mean and standard deviation to calculate the z-score for a test value of 24.

```{r}


```

### Step 2: which area of the curve?

Consider which area of the curve you are trying to calculate. Let's visualize this a bit. The plot below produces a normally distributed curve with the mean and standard deviation specified in the problem. Add a vertical line to the value you are using using the `geom_vline()` geometry. Learn about this geometry and its arguments with `?`. 

Q1. Do you want to cover the portion of the curve to the right or to the left of this line?

Hint: You are looking for the probability of getting a score greater than 24. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(10, 30)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 20, sd = 3))
```
Q2. Make a rough estimate of the percentage of the curve that would fall in the direction you've selected in Q1.


### Step 3: Calculate the area that is in the tail given the z-score

Use `pnorm()` to calculate the probability cut point for your z-score. The help file for pnorm is kind of a lot, so it may not be very helpful for you, but you can refer to lecture slides to format the function.

```{r}

```


Q3. Did the probability/percentage you came up with match with your expectations? If not, check your work - did you specify the correct tail and/or substract the resulting probability from 1 if needed?



## Problem 2

Let's reverse the direction of this problem. We are still using the same test of sensitivity to cilantro's soapy taste, which is still known to have a mean of 20, a standard deviation of 3, and to follow a normal curve. What raw test score would be needed to land in the top 75% of the distribution?


### Step 1: Find the probability value that represents the right cutpoint on the distribution

Use the image below to calculate roughly the point in the distribution where the data is separated into the top 75% of the distribution and its other portion.

Q1. Considering the cutpoint you selected, the normal distribution and the coverage of the standard deviations, in which z-scores range should you expect your Z-score to fall to cover the top 75%?

### Step 2: Calculate the Z-score that corresponds to the probability threshold

Use `qnorm()` for this. This function works much the same as `pnorm()` but takes a probability and returns a z-score.

```{r}

```

Q2. Did the z-score fall in the range you anticipated it to? If not, check your probability value.

### Step 3: Solve the z-score equation 

Now that you have the z-score, and you already know the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution, use the z-score equation to solve for the raw score needed to attain that z-score.

Again, the z-score formula is: z = (X-mean)/sd

```{r}

```

Q3. What score is needed on the test in order to fall into the top 75% of the distribution?
